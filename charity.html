      <p>The severeness of the Earth environment never get out of human sight. Because of wildfire, flood, air pollution and etc., nature and wildlife suffer hard with habitat recent years. In order to help wildlife build home and protect nature environment, the website here works to help passioned people to be a part of the charity and share kindness for the Earth and wildlife.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our charity holds the concept of helping wildlife and saving nature by collecting donation and protecting the habitats. We gently welcome all the people who want to share their kindness to the nature and animals who deserve helping. By purchasing the charityâ€™s unique calendar, you can be involved into the charity as a member and provide the money as donation to us, which helps us all to reach our goal.</p>
